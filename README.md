<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Widespread distributed fracturing during earthquakes threatens infrastructure and lifelines. We combine high-resolution rupture maps from the four major surface-rupturing strike-slip earthquakes in southern California and northern Mexico since 1992 to incorporate the displacements produced by secondary faulting and fracturing into a probabilistic displacement hazard analysis framework. Through analysis of the length and spatial distribution of mapped fractures for each event, we develop an expression for the probability of finding a fracture that accommodates a displacement that exceeds a given threshold Do at a given distance away from the fault. In our model, Do is a user-input variable that may be adjusted for different engineering applications. To facilitate general use, we accompany this study with a Python Jupyter notebook that produces a hazard curve with robust uncertainties for end-user application. Our model is best applied to estimating expected secondary displacements for strike-slip earthquakes, similar to those analyzed, with widespread fracturing across immature fault zones.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

The general model described runs on Python Jupyter Notebooks. 
Full reproduction of the work of Rodriguez Padilla and Oskin (202N) relies on Matlab as well.
